## What Is an Emergency Water Shut Off Valve?

An emergency water shut off valve is a control point that stops the flow of water into a property. It is used during plumbing failures such as burst pipes, major leaks, appliance line breaks, or frozen pipe incidents to prevent water damage.

Shut off valves exist at both the **property level** and the **municipal service connection level**, depending on system design and local infrastructure.

## Why Location Awareness Matters in Georgetown

Georgetown’s colder winters, foothill terrain, and mixed-era housing stock increase the importance of fast water shutoff during emergencies. Frozen or burst pipes can release large volumes of water quickly, especially in homes with long service lines or uninsulated plumbing runs.

Knowing the shut off valve location in advance reduces response time and limits structural and interior damage during emergencies.

## Residential vs. Municipal Shut Off Points
